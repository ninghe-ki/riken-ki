# RIKEN-KI Bioinformatics Analysis and Visualisation of Medical Genomics Data

KI course number H7F5633, October 2025 

Document version date: 2025-08-10


### Introduction

This course is based on student feedback such as: We would like to learn how to make publication-quality plots as they are shown in high-profile genomics journals. In this course, we invite the lead bioinformatics authors of high-quality genomics articles, ask them to bring the data from their published articles, and guide course participants in redoing some of the published figures. In the mornings we have lectures from the teachers. The afternoons are hands-on workshops where the course participants work in small groups of around five students. The students stay in the same group for the whole week and work on one paper. The bioinformatics lead author of that paper is the mentor for that group.

### Learning Outcomes

After the completed course, the participants can understand the principles and perform basic bioinformatics analysis of genomics sequencing data. The participants can plan experimental designs and critically evaluate the appropriateness of the different sequencing based omics methods and technologies for genome-wide gene regulation studies.

### Practical aspects

This course has two parts:

The first course Week 1 consists of assignments conducted by the course participants from their own work place during Week 1 (September 25 to October 1, 2025) of the course.

The second course Week 2 (October 2 to 8, 2025) will be conducted at RIKEN Yokohama Campus, Japan, and will consist of lectures, discussion and hands-on practical work analyzing datasets using the software package R or alternatively Python.

All course participants are required to address all the below tasks (some tasks are marked as optional) and to share the results of assignments with peer-review partners using Gitlab, Github, Fishare or a similar publication platform. Please see submission details and deadlines below.
